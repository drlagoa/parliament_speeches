### Code for Master's Dissertation, 2023

---

This repository contains the code required to implement the analysis of a master's dissertation which applies a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic modeling to Portuguese Parliamentary debates.

The code allows us to depart from publicly available verbatim transcripts of debates to visualizations of the different topics that characterize the speech of different political parties in different legislative sessions.
